        <p> 
            One of the highlights for me of becoming vegetarian was going to my local
            farmer's market a lot more and realizing how many and diverse vegetables 
            there are. These made me want to try out a lot more veggie based recipes
            rather than relying on meat-substitutes. During my interent scrolling I came
            across a common recipe: buddha bowls. Bowls packed with an assortment of veggies,
            grains, leaves, seeds, dressings--you name it. Hence, I sought to create my own 
            version of a buddha bowl which I present to you today. This one has the perfect 
            level of crunch, flavor, and contrast.
