        <p>
            I'm so glad you've come across my page so that you can try out my go-to 
            recipe for chocoalte chip cookies. These always turn out perfectly gooey
            in the middle and crispy on the outside. These make enough for whatever 
            event you're throwing--either for yourself, family, or friends. I gurantee
            you these will be gone within minutes; they're not only delicious but even
            easier to make.

        <h2>Steps</h2> 
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees fairenheit.</li>
            <li>Cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar until mixed and 
                all lumps are gone at medium speed.  
            </li> 
            <li>Add in vanilla extract and eggs and mix on low speed. Do not overmix. Mix
                until eggs are just incorporated. 
            </li> 
            <li>In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, and baking soda.</li> 
            <li>While mixing on low speed, add in increments the dry ingredients into the wet.</li> 
            <li>Once mixed, add in the chocolate chips.</li> 
            <li>Drop ~2 tablespoons of dough for each cookie on a parchment-lined baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Let cookies bake in oven for 10 minutes. Sprike salt on top for more flavor if you want!</li>
            <li>Once out of the oven, let cookies sit on the sheet for 3 minutes. Then, 
                transfer to a baking sheet. They may look undone but as they sit they'll harden
                on the outside. 
            </li>
