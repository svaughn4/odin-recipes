        <p>
            I'm so glad you've come across my page so that you can try out my go-to 
            recipe for chocoalte chip cookies. These always turn out perfectly gooey
            in the middle and crispy on the outside. These make enough for whatever 
            event you're throwing--either for yourself, family, or friends. I gurantee
            you these will be gone within minutes; they're not only delicious but even
            easier to make.
