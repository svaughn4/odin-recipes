        <h1>Vegan Pancakes Recipe</h1> 
        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p> 
            All of my recipes come from a special place in my heart, but these especially
            are one of my favorite recipes to date. For starters, they're vegan. So say 
            goodbye to dairy issues. Second, they're absolutely <strong>delicious</strong>. 
            They only take 10 minutes to make and create thick but slightly gooey pancakes. 
            I'd reccomend using as ripe of bananas as you can and serving these with some 
            nut butter and maple syrup. If you're not a fan of bananas, then I'd suggest finding 
            another recipe. Regardless, I gurantee the whole family or your tummy will want more!
