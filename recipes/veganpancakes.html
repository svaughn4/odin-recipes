        <h1>Vegan Pancakes Recipe</h1> 
        <h2>Description</h2> 
        <p> 
            All of my recipes come from a special place in my heart, but these especially
            are one of my favorite recipes to date. For starters, they're vegan. So say 
            goodbye to dairy issues. Second, they're absolutely <strong>delicious</strong>. 
            They only take 10 minutes to make and create thick but slightly gooey pancakes. 
            I'd reccomend using as ripe of bananas as you can and serving these with some 
            nut butter and maple syrup. If you're not a fan of bananas, then I'd suggest finding 
            another recipe. Regardless, I gurantee the whole family or your tummy will want more!

                need to wipe down the sides of the blender periodically.

            <li>Transfer the batter to a bowl and let sit for 5 minutes to thicken.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat a cast-iron skillet up at high heat for 4 minutes. Then
